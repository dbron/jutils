<<
	The Romans usually wrote IIII for 4 and XXXX for 40. The number 949 was DCCCCXXXXVIIII. To shorten the
	length of such numbers a "subtraction rule" appeared in later Roman times and was commonly used in
	medieval times. The "subtraction rule" allows the use of six compound symbols in which a smaller unit
	precedes the larger:
	
	IV = 4
	IX = 9
	XL = 40
	XC = 90
	CD = 400
	CM = 900

	Using these symbols, 949 is written more compactly as CMXLIX. (Other "subtracted" symbols are not allowed.
	Thus 99 must written XCIX, not IC.) The use of subtracted symbols was never mandatory, so IIII and IV can
	be used interchangeably for 4.
>>
 
It would be neat to generalize this.  What does it mean to generalize, though?
Maybe to finding the shortest way to express the number?

<<
	Actually, the symbols D (500) and M (1000) were originally written using a vertical stroke with surrounding arcs; 
	these arcs can only be approximated on this page by using parentheses. D appeared as I ) and M as ( I ). 
	This system allowed powers of ten larger than 1000 to be written by increasing the number of arcs: 10 000 was 
	written (( I )) and 100 000 was written ((( I ))).  The Romans had no word for 1 000 000 and rarely considered
	numbers of that size or larger. In late Roman and medieval times, after D and M were adopted as the symbols for
	500 and 1000, a custom arose of writing a bar over a number to multiply that number by 1000. Thus 10 000 became
	X with a bar over it and 100 000 became C with a bar over it. These "overbarred" symbols are almost never seen
	today.
>>

Should I replace strings of Ms with "arced" Ms?

<<
	In Roman times, only the capital letters were used for number symbols. Later, after lower case letters came into
	use, Roman numbers were often written in lower case. Thus "vi" means 6 and "cxxii" means 122. Sometimes cases were
	even mixed, as in "Mcxl" for 1140. Furthermore, the lower case letter "j" was sometimes used in place of "i". A
	common custom was to write "j" for the last in a series of one's, as in "xiij" for 13.
>>

Allow a flag that indiciates the use of the 'j' rule.
